(a) In the header file "GLWidget.h", there are 6 shapes
Square (used for lowerbeak, legs, feet)
Circle (used for joints and eye)
Head
Body
Arm
Upperbeak

(b) Following sets exist
In "GLWidget.cpp", push and pop are arranged as following
(Body) - push, pop
(Arm) - push, pop
(Head, lowerbeak, upperbeak) - push,push,push,pop,pop,pop
(Rightleg, Rightfoot) - push,push,pop,pop
(Leftleg, Leftfoot) - push,push,pop,pop

All parts have its tranlation to the pivot point (rotational point) in terms of body 
width and body length. This is because Body is the root of the tree. 

(C)
Rotational movements are implemented using sin function and RotateInDegrees
Translational movements are implemented using sin function and Translate

Every part that has either rotational or translation movements have its own angle defined. 
This is to control the movement range and speed for each part

(d)
This part is implemented throughout the function "void GLWidget::paintGL()"

(e)
Six rotational joints are drawn with white circles
